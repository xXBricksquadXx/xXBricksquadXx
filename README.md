## 📡 The Mission: Utility & Entanglement
I view software not as a silo, but as an entangled system—much like **QFT (Quantum Field Theory)** suggests, everything is connected. 

My background (Infantry/EW) taught me that reality is complex; my current work is about building tools to navigate that complexity. I focus on **Legal Tech** and **Data Systems** because they are the fundamental fields that govern human interaction.

**My repositories are team efforts and open explorations.** I am here to:
* **De-mystify** legal processes through automation.
* **Democratize** data analysis with local-first tools.
* **Collaborate** on solutions that actually work in reality.

## 🔬 Collaborative Labs

| Domain | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⚖️ Legal Engineering** | *Making the law accessible.* <br> Projects focused on Tennessee Open Records, FDCPA compliance, and transparency. |
| **⚛️ QFT & Data** | *Modeling complexity.* <br> Using `DuckDB` and `Python` to find patterns in the noise. |
| **🛠️ Utility** | *Small tools, big impact.* <br> PDF utilities, signers, and communicators designed for efficiency. |

## 🧩 Active Explorations
*These are open for inspection, fork, and contribution.*

| Experiment | The "Why" | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**TN Legal RAG**](https://github.com/xXBricksquadXx/TN-Legal-RAG) | Because legal data shouldn't be a black box. A retrieval system for TN records. | `Python` `AI` |
| [**Debt Validation Prompter**](https://github.com/xXBricksquadXx/Debt-Validation-Prompter) | Empowering individuals with agentic workflows for FDCPA compliance. | `JS` `Legal-Tech` |
| [**CSV Studio**](https://github.com/xXBricksquadXx/csv-studio-duckdb) | A lightning-fast way to query data without setting up enterprise servers. | `DuckDB` `Streamlit` |
| [**Petition to DC**](https://github.com/xXBricksquadXx/petition2dc) | Dockerized utility for standardized, high-reliability legislative action. | `Docker` `Civic-Tech` |
